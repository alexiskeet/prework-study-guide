## Description

This webpage was designed to help keep track of the things I've learned from the prework for this bootcamp. I built this project in order to practice creating websites while reflecting on the information I've learned about the different parts of coding. This solves the problem of trying to organize my notes on my own and it taught me how to code while doing it!
